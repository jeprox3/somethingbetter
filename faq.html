Q. Do you use environmentally-friendly products? A. Yes, let us explain:
• Many (but certainly not all) green products don't work as well as traditional cleaning
products which require using more product, more water, and more time which adds up to more cost for you AND the environment. We use a portfolio of products designed to be healthier for the environment and your pocketbook. Our all-purpose cleaner is an orange cleaner which:
o is a citrus solvent O has biodegradable detergents that are phosphate-free
o uses color-fast hydrogen peroxide rather than noxious bleach
• Our tile and vinyl floor cleaner:
o is pine-based o cleans, disinfects, and deodorizes
O Inhibits the growth of mold and mildew We use Bruce Hardwood and Laminate Floor Cleaner by Armstrong for, well, hardwood
and laminate floors since a vast majority of our clients have Armstrong flooring. Armstrong requires use of this product to maintain their warranty. Our glass cleaner is ammonia-free Most of our cleaning solutions come in concentrate form which saves on packaging and transportation emissions.
Q. Do I have to provide anything for the cleaners? A. Nope! We provide the cleaning products and equipment needed to clean your space. You don't have to worry about anything.
Q. Will you use my cleaning products if I want? How about my vacuum cleaner? A. Absolutely! If you want us to use any or all of your products and equipment, we'll be more than happy to. Just remember that we aren't able to replace bags or belts on your vacuum cleaner and if it's not picking debris up well, we can't warrant our work.
Q. Do I pay the cleaner after each cleaning? A. Nope! We're trying to make life easier for you AND our cleaners. Your cleaner is juggling a cleaning kit, vacuum, and other supplies so keeping track of payments can be cumbersome. Also, we don't want you to have to think about payment every time we come to clean. After your first cleaning, we'll email an invoice (we can send via US Mail if you prefer) which tells you how long we worked and what the cost is. You have 15 days from that point to pay your bill. Future invoices will be sent several business days after each month ends. These invoices will
detail the dates, hours, and cost each time we cleaned. Once again, you have 15 days to send in your payment.
Q. What happens if I'm not happy with my service? A. We strive to provide 100% satisfaction, however, if this is ever not the case, please contact us within 24 hours of your cleaning service so that we can discuss any issues and determine the best resolution. If corrective action is required, we will send a worker to your home as quickly as possible to resolve the problem, usually within 24-48 hours.
Q. My last cleaners were great until they just stopped showing up. Is that going to happen with you guys? A. Absolutely not! When we make a scheduling commitment to you, we keep it! If you ever need to change the scheduled date, please let us know at least 24 business hours before your
cleaning. As for us, we'll be there when we say we will!


Q. I need cleaning and organizing. Can you do them at the same time? A. Almost but not quite. Organizing and cleaning require 2 very different types of service and we can only do one at a time. We always start with organizing because that allows us to remove any clutter that is blocking areas which need to be cleaned. We love jumping into cleaning right after organizing so that you can achieve the fastest enjoyment of your space. That wonderful moment when all is right with the world and you feel the relief of your burdens lifted.
Q. What's the difference between de-cluttering and organizing? A. 95% of the time, when most people talk about organizing, they're really referring to de-cluttering.
De-cluttering is the act of removing items that are no longer needed, used, or wanted. Organizing is the act of positioning items that remain after de-cluttering in places that improve workflow or aesthetics.
Q. Do I have to be there when you work in my home? A. It's entirely up to you. We are able to do a lot of de-cluttering and organizing when the client isn't present by talking over your guidelines with you prior to beginning our work. We'll set aside items that fall outside those guidelines for you to review and give us your thoughts on when you return home. If you would like to work alongside us that is perfectly fine too. We're happy to be able to pick your brain as we work regarding your wishes AND teach you basic organizing skills to help you maintain your space.
Q. I'm so embarrassed about how my house looks. Have you ever seen anything this bad?
A. We wish that each and every person we work with understood that we truly come in with no judgment. We fully realize that but for the grace of God, ANY of us could find ourselves in a situation where life--and our home--is out of control. We are not there to judge--we're there to help and we love doing exactly that. It is thrilling to be able to give someone an important part of their life back--their home.
Q. What happens to the things that I'm not keeping? A. We'll determine that before the job even starts. Discarded items typically go into the trash, are given to thrift organizations, or are set apart for friends or relatives to pick-up. We have many resources for trash pick-up as well as donation organizations. We'll be glad to work with
you to figure out which options you prefer.
