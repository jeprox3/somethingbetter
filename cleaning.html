    <div class="content-subheadline">"Spring Cleaning"</div>

  <li>Oven cleaning</li>

We provide all cleaning products and equipment. We provide a <strong>free quote</strong> for the level of service that fits your needs. SOME of the post-construction cleaning tasks we perform are:

    <div class="content-subheadline">Move-in/Move-out Cleaning</div>
Moving into a home and out of a home is a busy, busy time. Both situations need cleaning services but they typically need very different types of service. We can handle both!<br><br>
<strong>Move-In Cleaning</strong><br>
When you're moving into a home, you want it to be YOUR home. You don't need unwelcome crumbs in the pantry, dried cough syrup in the medicine chest, or dusty baseboards to remind you of the previous owner. We'd love to make your new home all yours and only yours.<br><br>

SOME of the move-in cleaning tasks we perform are:
<uL>
  <li>Wet wipe doors, trim, and baseboards throughout</li>
  <li>Wash window interiors and exteriors</li>
  <li>Clean wall and light fixtures</li>
  <li>Clean appliance interiors and exteriors</li>
  <li>Clean inside pantry, drawers, cupboards in the kitchen</li>
  <li>Clean inside drawers, cupboards, and medicine chests in the bathrooms</li>
  <li>Vacuum and mop floors</li>
  <li>Remove cobwebs in the basement</li>
  <li>Remove cobwebs and dirt in the garage</li>
</ul>
<strong>Move-Out Cleaning</strong><br>
Moving out of a home can be a bit different than moving in. Your real estate agent will usually
tell you that you just need to 'broom sweep' your home. That means that you only need to do a very basic wipe and vacuum of surfaces. Some of our clients, however, like to do a deeper cleaning for the new owner. We'll work with you to learn what YOUR specific wishes are and will carry them out to a 'T'.
